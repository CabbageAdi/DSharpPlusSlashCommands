# Installing
This hasn't been pushed to nuget, so you'll have to build it yourself. A basic guide:
* Clone the repository
* If using visual studio, do `Build -> Build Solution` or just F6 (if using something else/command line, google it)
* DLLs should be created in the `bin` folders
* In your bot project, in the solution explorer, right click on dependencies -> Add Project Reference, and add the DLLs for whatever modules of D#+ you use

If you need any help with this, the discord server is always open.
